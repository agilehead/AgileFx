This folder contains the IQTookit release used in the latest AgileFx distribution. It is included so that developers can download the corresponding IQTookit release with a single checkout. 

Note that the licenses for IQTookit are different from AgileFx (MsPL vs Apache 2.0). However, they are both open-source and not in conflict.

Special thanks to Matt for the awesome toolkit.
